## Project Description

This project is a clone of the iPhone 15 page, built using modern web technologies such as React, GSAP, and Three.js. It replicates the visual experience of the official iPhone 15 page, including smooth animations, 3D effects, and a responsive design.

### Key Libraries and Tools:

- **React**: The core library for building the UI components.
- **GSAP**: Used for creating smooth and efficient animations throughout the page.
- **Three.js**: Powers the 3D elements to provide an immersive experience.
- **@react-three/fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, enabling easier integration with React components.
- **@react-three/drei**: Utility functions to enhance and simplify working with Three.js in React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling the project.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.

This setup allows for a modular, high-performance web application with animations and interactive 3D models.
